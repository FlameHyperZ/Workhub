	<p> <b>Groak </b> – while the origin of this word is unknown, it means to watch someone silently <br>
		as they eat, in the hope that you will be invited to join them. For instance, how am I supposed<br>
		to enjoy my sushi while that guy is groaking me the entire time? Whoa, that sounds similar to<br>
		something else…maybe let’s not revive that one… </p>
